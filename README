This project is a simple python script that runs as a daemon. It creates a
fifo in the user's home directory from which it reads a list of files. It then
passes those files to another exe to process - by default mplayer. It also
accepts a number of control commands - these are separated from filenames by
null characters.

The same exe can also be invoked in such a way as to provide user control over
the daemon via the pipe. This mode can be considered as the 'user space'
tools.
